## go-tvdb

client library for the TVDB API

### supported versions
| go-tvdb | TVDB API |
| --- | --- |
| v1.0.0 | v3.0.0 |

### usage

most of the code here was generated by [go-swagger](github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger) from the [official tvdb swagger spec](api.thetvdb.com/swagger#). these bindings are usable directly by importing the `generated` package. the generated client is unintuitive to use (mostly due to the tvdb api being inconsistent and not fully REST-ful), so a light wrapper client is provided in the root package that normalizes common api interactions.


### todo

complete the wrapper so that calling the generated client is never necessary.

### license

`go-tvdb` is licensed MPL-2 which means you can use it as you please with no restrictions EXCEPT: if you distribute it or derivative works, you must provide the source (a link is sufficient) OF THIS LIBRARY including any modifications that you make to THIS LIBRARY.
